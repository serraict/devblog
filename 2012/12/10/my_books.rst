`The Pragmatic Programmer, tip 8: <http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/software-engineering-and-development/020161622x/a-pragmatic-philosophy/ch01lev1sec5>`_

    Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio; 
    Make learning a habit. 

I find reading to be an enjoyable activity,
but it's also a necessity in staying up-to-date
in our knowledge-intensive industry.
I read most books on my tablet, 
using InformIT's `Safari Books Online <http://www.safaribooksonline.com/>`_ - 
a service I highly recommend to any professional in IT.

I've added a page with my :ref:`book-shelves`; 
you might find a good read there.

Feel free to recommend me a book or two!
